# MainChain

Planning And Under construction！

1. Who are we?
2. 
The initial team of ATU is a technology enthusiast who loves blockchain from various industrial positions in the communication sector. He has been engaged in design and development work such as radio frequency, modem, communication chip and so on.
Although we are not from the same company or the same country, we usually love to get together to discuss the future of technology and current development hotspots and directions.
We have always cherished the dream of using youth to turn into new technological hotspots, creating new technological things belonging to an era, and adding impetus to social civilization.

2. What do we want to do?
ATU main chain plans to develop a global, decentralized, new chat tool that no one can monitor content for chat communication innovation.
After its content is encrypted, in addition to using point-to-point transmission as much as possible, for the content that needs to be stored temporarily or needs to be saved for a certain period of time,
We will do our best to store based on the blocks of the blockchain and generate mining value, thereby generating an ecological closed loop.

3. What are we going to do?

The chat communication software under the ATU main chain plan can be expected to have a huge number of users, which exceeds that of Facebook.
At that time, various currencies based on the ATU main chain will have expected value, especially those dominated by it.
Tokens with stable prices will be used as effective payment vouchers in communication software, suitable for daily transactions and daily circulation.
ATU stablecoin will become a truly global digital currency based on user consensus.
It will be comparable to BTC and has more liquidity. At the same time, it will not affect the value due to the government's credit crisis or additional issuance, nor will it affect the circulation due to the country's long-arm jurisdiction.
It can not be influenced by politics and truly realize the dream of Swiss bank to protect the privacy of assets for customers.

4. Who is our absentee union?

Before the ATU main chain is really completed, it will issue consensus coins such as DEFI and NFT based on the existing mature public chain, and develop the first batch of loyal fans through market rules.
When the main chain officially releases the top ore, the fans will exchange the ATU consensus coins on a voluntary basis, and adopt the freezing or destruction rules to absorb the consensus coins that have been issued based on other public chains.
This batch of fans will fully distribute the ATU main chain head mines in proportion and publish them directly to the mining machine accounts, and become the first batch of absenteeism.

5. What are the benefits of ATU's absenteeism?

ATU's miners can benefit when they generate blocks. It will provide temporary node carriers and secret key distribution services for peer-to-peer communication information, and will obtain distribution revenues that have not been mined;
At the same time, it does not require temporary or long-term storage of information to provide storage services, and will obtain service fees paid by users and distribution revenues from non-mining.
ATU’s absenteeism will also benefit from service fees for users’ daily transactions and transfers.

6. What are the characteristics of ATU's mining machines?

ATU's mining machine will be designed into a large node version and a family node version.
ATU large node version: Based on the version design with stronger bandwidth and storage capacity, it will store and distribute a large amount of videos, pictures, files, dynamic secret keys, transaction transfer information, etc. for users.
Need to have a larger throughput capacity. Will get larger dynamic service income. The design power is 300 watts.
ATU small-node family version: a design scheme based on a 17-watt low-power host and moderate storage capacity.
Based on P2P communication, temporary communication information of users near the node will be stored for users, as well as the storage of user's relatively sluggish information, and the storage service fee income paid by users will be obtained.
Also based on storage capacity, you can get storage service income of videos, pictures, files, information, etc., as well as the income of non-mining distribution.
The theoretical peak power consumption is 1 kWh for 100 hours, and the idle service running power with full storage and less distribution is 1 kWh for 200 hours, striving for environmental protection.


1、我们是谁？

ATU初始团队，来自各个通信门类的产业岗位的热爱区块链的技术爱好者。之前一直从事诸如射频、Modem、通信芯片等设计研发工作。
虽然我们不是来自同一家公司，也不是同一个国家，但是我们平常特别热爱聚在一起探讨技术的未来以及当下的发展热点和方向。
我们一直怀揣梦想，要用青春化作新的技术热点，创作出属于一个时代的新的技术事物，为社会文明添动力。

2、我们想要做什么？

ATU主链计划为聊天通讯创新研发一款属于全球的，去中心化的，无人可以监控内容的新聊天工具。
它的内容经过加密后除了尽量使用点对点传输外，对于需要临时需要存储或者一定时间内需要保存的内容，
我们将全力基于区块链的块进行存储，并产生挖矿价值，从而产生生态闭环。

3、我们要做成什么样？

ATU主链计划下的聊天通讯软件可以预计它的庞大用户量，超过Facebook可期。
届时，基于ATU主链的各类币将有可期待的价值，特别是由它主导的
价格稳定的代币将在通讯软件里可以作为有效的支付凭证，适合日常交易和生活流通使用。
ATU稳定币将基于用户共识，成为真正流通于全球的数字货币。
它将比肩于BTC，且更具有流通性，同时还不会因政府信用危机或增发影响价值，也不会因国家长臂管辖影响流通。
它可以不受政治影响，真正实现瑞士银行为客户保护资产隐私的梦想。

4、我们的旷工会是谁？

ATU主链在真正完成建设之前，会基于现有成熟的公链发行DEFI、NFT等共识币，通过市场法则发展第一批忠实粉丝。
在主链正式发布头矿时 ，会把粉丝拥有ATU共识币按自愿原则兑换，并采取冻结或销毁的法则吸收基于其它公链已发的共识币。
这批粉丝将按比例完全分配ATU主链头矿，并直接发布到矿机账户，并成为第一批旷工。

5、ATU的旷工会有什么好处？

ATU的矿机在产生区块的时候就可以获益，它将为点对点的通讯信息提供临时节点载体和秘钥分发服务，将获得未出矿的分发收益；
同时，它也未需要临时或较长时间存储的信息提供存储服务，将获得用户支付的服务费和未出矿的分发收益。
ATU旷工还将获得用户日常交易和转账等的服务手续费的收益。

6、ATU的矿机有什么特色？

ATU的矿机将设计成大节点版本和家庭节点版本。
ATU大节点版本：基于较强带宽和存储容量的版本设计，将为用户存储分发量较大的视频、图片、文件以及动态秘钥、交易转账信息等。
需要具备较大吞吐能力。将获得较大的动态服务收益。设计功率300瓦特。
ATU小节点家庭版本：基于17瓦特的小功率主机以及适度存储容量的设计方案。
基于P2P通信，将为用户存储节点附近用户的临时通讯信息，以及用户较为呆滞的信息的存储，获取用户支付的存储服务费收益。
同样基于存储容量可以获得视频、图片、文件、信息等的存储服务收益，以及未出矿分发收益。
耗电功率理论运行峰值100小时1度电，满存储少分发的呆滞服务运行功率为200小时1度电，力争环保。
